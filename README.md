# domain-name-generator

Random domain name generator, that lists all possible domain names from a combination of different arrays. Also practicing modifying styles via JS.

The site will generate an array with all possible combinations of pre-defined pronoun, adjective, noun, and extension arrays, and will dynamically split it into two ordered lists.
